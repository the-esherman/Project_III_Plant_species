# Project III Plant species

### Part of PhD studies of Emil A.S. Andersen

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This project is for analysis (and data cleaning) of a year-round
seasonal project that dealt with plant nitrogen uptake in a subarctic
ecosystem located in the north of Sweden.

To better work with and across with other collaborators, I will make
certain parts of this project public.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
